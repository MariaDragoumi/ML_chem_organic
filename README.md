## Introduction
The properties of atoms, molecules and materials are maybe the most fundamental aspect of understanding the world that we interact with.
Moreover, desing of new matter structures with desirable properies has been leading the technology advancement, with achievments on a wide spectrum of applications afecting our daily life, from lithum batteries used in our smartphones to drug discovery that can save lives. The applicattions of material desing are astonishing.

In the traditional science, new materials are discovered by either experimentation or theoretical calculations. Both processes are time-costly and highly inefficient. 
This is where Machine Learning enters. Enabling the capitalization of the data optained by traditional methods, sets new horizons on the material descovery field, which were inaccessible by traditional methods. 

## About the project

In this project I have developed a Machine Leraning model to predict properties of small organic molecules. 
To train and validate my model, I have used the GDB7-13 Dataset, which can be found here: https://qmml.org/datasets.html. It contains 7k stable small organic molecules, consisting of up to 7 attoms of the elements C, N, O, S and Cl  and It was generated for Machine Learning purposes (see here: https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/15/9/095003).

The purpose of this project was two-fold. First was to explore and improve past models for small organic molecules. The second goal was to be presended to non-expert audiance. 
For this reason I developed a web application using streamlit. Before I go into detals about the data and the model I will sortly describe the files included and how to install the web application.

The model was build by following at my best of efort the guide lines described here: https://rdcu.be/cMDFt
